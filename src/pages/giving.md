## Donation Requests

Eltana wants to help your charitable organization achieve its goals.

We often donate bagels and spreads. We can't donate coffee â€“ sorry. Many organizations ask us for gift cards for an auction or to reward volunteers. We love that request.

Please send an email with your request to: poppy@eltana.com

Please include (if relevant):

- What do you want exactly?
- What is the name of your organization?
- When is your event?
- What else do we need to know?

Thank you!
