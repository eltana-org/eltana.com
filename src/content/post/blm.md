## BLM Statement

Eltana condemns the senseless murder of George Floyd and all the pervasive, insidious, societal systems that allow such a horrific atrocity to be as American as apple pie.

We support Black Lives Matter and all protesters who continue to turn the screws on the system in a way that cannot be ignored. Keep it up.

If you are a protester looking for a snack during the daytime – come to Eltana any day for a free bagel and a spread – just say "I’m hungry for justice".

If you are inclined to put your money where your mouth is, so are we. Make a donation of $25 or more to any of the following organizations and we will give you a free half dozen bagels to show our gratitude for funding the good fight:

- Blacklivesmatter.com
- Campaign Zero
- Color of Change
- Any other organization you believe will bring about change toward a more just world
